## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Among the things I was able to learn and practice in this project are: the use of gradients; the use of rounded edges and the placement of images.

Here are some examples:

```html
<div class="result-container"></div>
```
```css
.result-container {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, var(--gradient-one) 0%, var(--gradiente-two) 50%, var(--gradient-three) 100%);
  border-radius: 0 0 4rem 4rem;
  }
```
```html
<div class="text reaction"><img src="img/icon-reaction.svg" alt="Icon Reaction">Reaction</div>
```

### Continued development

In this project I could not implement the information injected through the JSON file provided, since I do not handle JavaScript, language that I will soon begin to study, for the moment I am learning HTML and CSS.

## Acknowledgments

I thank Frontend Mentor for providing free resources to put into practice what I have learned, and above all a place to show them.
